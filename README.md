# amazons

-Intro-
The game of Amazons is a simple but rather interesting board game, usually for two players. It was invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina, and originally called El Juego de las Amazonas (now a trademark of Ediciones de Mente). The board is a 10 by 10 chessboard. Each player gets four "amazons" (represented as chess queens), white for the player who moves first, and black for the opponent. 

-Rules-
Each move consists of two parts: first, an amazon of the appropriate color makes a chess queen moveâ€”any non-zero number of squares in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with the restriction that the piece may not move onto or through an occupied square. Pieces are not captured in this game; the board keeps getting fuller. Next, the piece that moved "throws a spear" from her final position. Spears move exactly like pieces, and are subject to the same restrictions. The spear sticks permanently in the (previously empty) square in which it lands. That square is counted as being occupied for the rest of the game (so no piece or spear may move through it). For example, the right diagram in Figure 1 shows the result of two moves. From the initial position, white moved from d1 to d7 and from there threw a spear to g7. Then black moved from d10 to c9, and from there threw a spear to h4.
A player who has no legal move loses. For example, after black moves a7-a6(a7) in Figure 2, he will have used up all his moves, and white (who still has plenty of room) will win after his next move. Draws are impossible.
